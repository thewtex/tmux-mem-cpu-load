About OpenBSD Port
==================

I've decided not to do OpenBSD port. Some preparations has been made both
by myself and (mainly) by Justin Crawford, so finish it shouldn't be difficult.
Personally, after installing OpenBSD and trying to finish the port I've
discovered that g++ supplied by OpenBSD (version 5.7) doesn't support c++11.
This means we lose the ability to use to_string() and stoi() functions. I could
write replacements for them, or try to get c++11 working on OpenBSD. But I
decided not to. At least for the moment.

I don't know OpenBSD, it's unfamiliar ground for me. And while FreeBSD was easy
to get into, I have found OpenBSD a little bit more difficult.

So, no OpenBSD port for now. If you are OpenBSD user and know a little bit c++
finishing the port should be easy (once you get C++11 working).
